Flexbox fiesta: From clueless to confident.

I've been struggling some with trying to learn flexbox.
Here is my attempt to try a landing page about one of my favorite artists.



After doing this project, I feel like my flexbox skills have improved. I got more confident after returning to some lessons to get a refreshere and I had to google some which also helped!

I feel like im not there yet, but I'm well on my way!
I'm so excited to go to the next project!
